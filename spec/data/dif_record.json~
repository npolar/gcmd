Most of the sections are from current NPI geologists. Some older thin sections are from Y. Ohta and others. Documentation is partly written on the sections themselves, on lists in the wooden storage boxes, or alternatively a sample number on the section refers to field note books. Interpretation and description is the responsibility of the individual geologists, and has mostly been used for publications. A good inventory of the thin sections archive is not yet available.","Purpose":""},"Originating_Metadata_Node":"NPI/RiS","Metadata_Name":"CEOS IDN DIF","Metadata_Version":"9.8.2","Private":"","Data_Set_Citation":[],"Personnel":[{"First_Name":"Winfried","Middle_Name":"Kurt","Last_Name":"Dallmann","Email":["winfried.dallmann@npolar.no"],"Role":["Investigator"]}],"Related_URL":[],"Discipline":[],"Data_Center":[],"Parameters":null,"ISO_Topic_Category":[],"Use_Constraints":null,"DIF_Creation_Date":"2008-03-27","Last_DIF_Revision_Date":"2008-03-27"}
